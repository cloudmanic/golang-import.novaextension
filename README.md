# Golang Tools for Nova

A extension for the [Nova](https://nova.app) editor.

**Golang Tools** provides the ability to run your .go files through goimports whenever you save or via a command. This extension also provides syntax highlighting for Go.

# Install

This extension should simply work out of the box. However, I am sure this goes without saying, you need to have Go installed, and in your $PATH. An easy way to install Go is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
